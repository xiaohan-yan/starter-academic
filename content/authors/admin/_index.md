I am a 4th-year math graduate student. My current research interests lie in algebraic geometry and symplectic topology, especially enumerative geometry problems in quantum K-theory. I am a student of Professor Alexander Givental. 

Before coming to Berkeley for graduate school, I went to Peking University for college. Before that, I was a student of the Gifted Education Program at Beijing No.8 Middle School.

Some non-math things I like to do: linguistics, hiking, soccer, badminton, gastronomy, and baking. My favorite drink is orange juice.
